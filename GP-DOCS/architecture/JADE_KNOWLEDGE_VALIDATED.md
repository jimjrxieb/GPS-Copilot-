## 🚀 How Tests Were Conducted

Each test validates Jade's knowledge by:

1. **Sending domain-specific queries** to Jade chat
2. **Analyzing responses** for relevant technical keywords
3. **Scoring based on knowledge demonstration**:
   - ✅ PASS: Keywords present, knowledge demonstrated
   - ❌ FAIL: Keywords missing, knowledge gap identified

Example test:
```python
def test_k8s_01_pod_security(self):
    """Test Pod Security Standards"""
    result = self.run_jade_command("check kubernetes policy")
    keywords = ['pod', 'security', 'kubernetes', 'policy', 'gatekeeper']
    self.assert_knowledge(result['stdout'], keywords,
                         "K8s: Pod security")
```
