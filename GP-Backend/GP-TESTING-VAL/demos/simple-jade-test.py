From the comprehensive knowledge base:

## Gatekeeper vs Traditional Scanners

**Key Difference:**
- **Scanners (Trivy, Checkov, Bandit)**: Run AFTER code is written, find problems, generate reports
- **Gatekeeper**: Runs BEFORE resources are deployed, actively PREVENTS bad configs

**Analogy:**
- Scanners are like TSA checking your luggage - they scan what you brought and tell you if there's a problem
- Gatekeeper is like a bouncer at a club - checks you at the door and won't let you in with wrong config

**Workflow Difference:**
Traditional: Write manifest → Scan → See violations → Fix manually → Re-scan
Gatekeeper: Write manifest → kubectl apply → API Server asks Gatekeeper → Policy violation → REJECTED

## How Gatekeeper Works with Kubernetes

**Admission Controller Flow:**
```
kubectl apply → API Server → Admission Controllers → etcd
```

**Gatekeeper Integration:**
1. Runs as ValidatingWebhookConfiguration in cluster
2. API Server sends requests to Gatekeeper webhook
3. Gatekeeper evaluates Rego policies against resource
4. Returns allow/deny to API server
5. API server accepts/rejects based on response

**Components:**
- **ConstraintTemplate**: Defines reusable policy templates
- **Constraint**: Instances that enforce specific policies
- **OPA Engine**: Evaluates Rego policies

**Technical Details:**
- Runs in gatekeeper-system namespace
- Uses OPA as policy engine
- Supports both validation and mutation
- Only affects NEW/UPDATED resources (existing resources unaffected)

# Simulate Jade's intelligent response using local Qwen2.5-7B + RAG knowledge
response = f"""Based on my security expertise and knowledge base analysis, here's the fundamental difference:

## Core Distinction

**Scanners (Trivy, Checkov, Bandit) - Reactive Detection:**
- Run AFTER code/configs are written
- Find vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in existing resources
- Generate reports highlighting issues
- Don't block anything - just inform you of problems

**Gatekeeper - Proactive Prevention:**
- Runs BEFORE resources are deployed to Kubernetes
- Actively PREVENTS bad configurations from being created
- Real-time policy enforcement at the API server level
- Acts as admission control gatekeeper (hence the name)

## Better Analogy

Think of scanners like TSA security - they check your luggage after you've packed it and tell you if there's a problem. Gatekeeper is like a bouncer at an exclusive club - it checks your credentials at the door and simply won't let you in if you don't meet the requirements.

## Workflow Comparison

**Traditional Scanning Flow:**
```
Write manifest → Run scanner → See violations → Fix manually → Re-scan → Deploy
```

**Gatekeeper Flow:**
```
Write manifest → kubectl apply → Gatekeeper policy check → IMMEDIATE reject if violation
```

## Why You Need Both

- **Trivy** finds vulnerable base images in your containers
- **Gatekeeper** prevents you from deploying containers from untrusted registries

- **Checkov** scans Terraform for misconfigurations
- **Gatekeeper** enforces organizational policies on what can be deployed

## Integration with Kubernetes

Gatekeeper works as a ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
1. You try to create/update a resource
2. Kubernetes API server consults Gatekeeper before allowing it
3. Gatekeeper evaluates your OPA/Rego policies
4. Returns allow/deny decision
5. API server either creates the resource or rejects it

**Key Point for Interviews:** "Gatekeeper is policy enforcement at deployment time, not vulnerability scanning of existing code. It's admission control, not security analysis."
