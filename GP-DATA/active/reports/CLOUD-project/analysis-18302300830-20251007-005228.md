## Top Priority Issues

### 1. Image Version Not Explicit

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** Dockerfile:1
- **Description:** Always tag the version of an image explicitly

### 2. Unpinned Actions Full Length Commit SHA

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** .github/workflows/security_scan.yml:247
- **Description:** Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload. When selecting a SHA, you should verify it is from the action's repository and not a repository fork.

### 3. Unpinned Actions Full Length Commit SHA
