## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Gate Discrepancy Detected

**ALERT:** The security gate reported different findings than actual scanner output.

- **Security Gate:** 43 findings missed
- **Gate Status:** May have incorrectly passed
- **Action Required:** Review security gate configuration

## Top Priority Issues

### 1. Missing User Instruction

- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** Dockerfile:1
- **Description:** A user should be specified in the dockerfile, otherwise the image will run as root

### 2. Privilege Escalation Allowed

- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** Containers should not run with allowPrivilegeEscalation in order to prevent them from gaining more privileges than their parent process

### 3. CPU Limits Not Set

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** CPU limits should be set because if the system has CPU time free, a container is guaranteed to be allocated as much CPU as it requests

### 4. CPU Requests Not Set

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** CPU requests should be set to ensure the sum of the resource requests of the scheduled Containers is less than the capacity of the node

### 5. Container Running As Root

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** Containers should only run as non-root user. This limits the exploitability of security misconfigurations and restricts an attacker's possibilities in case of compromise

### 6. Container Running With Low UID

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** Check if containers are running with low UID, which might cause conflicts with the host's user table.

### 7. Image Version Not Explicit

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** Dockerfile:1
- **Description:** Always tag the version of an image explicitly

### 8. Memory Limits Not Defined

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** Memory limits should be defined for each container. This prevents potential resource exhaustion by ensuring that containers consume not more than the designated amount of memory

### 9. Memory Requests Not Defined

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** Memory requests should be defined for each container. This allows the kubelet to reserve the requested amount of system resources and prevents over-provisioning on individual nodes

### 10. NET_RAW Capabilities Not Being Dropped

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scanner:** kics
- **File:** deployment-service.yaml:16
- **Description:** Containers should drop 'ALL' or at least 'NET_RAW' capabilities

## Recommendations

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH Priority:** Address 2 HIGH severity finding(s) within 1 week
3. üìã **MEDIUM Priority:** Plan remediation for 30 MEDIUM findings
