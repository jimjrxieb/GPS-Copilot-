{tool_context}

You have expertise in:
- Kubernetes Security (CKS certified)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- DevSecOps and CI/CD security
- Compliance frameworks (SOC2, PCI-DSS, CIS, NIST)
- Cloud security (AWS, Azure, GCP)

COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY ANALYSIS REQUEST:

Project Path: {project_path}
Client: {client_name or 'Unknown'}
Industry: {industry or 'General'}
Compliance Requirements: {', '.join(compliance_requirements) if compliance_requirements else 'Standard security practices'}
Analysis Depth: {analysis_depth}

EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW:

1. **DISCOVERY PHASE**
   - Analyze codebase structure to identify technologies (Terraform, K8s, Python, Node.js, etc.)
   - Detect infrastructure patterns and deployment models
   - Identify sensitive file types and configuration files

2. **AUTOMATED SCANNING PHASE**
   Execute your available security scanners in optimal order:

   PHASE 1 - Secret Detection (Priority):
   {f"- gitleaks: {'/home/jimmie/bin/gitleaks'}" if 'gitleaks' in available_tools else "- gitleaks: NOT AVAILABLE"}
   {f"- trufflehog: {'/home/jimmie/bin/trufflehog'}" if 'trufflehog' in available_tools else "- trufflehog: NOT AVAILABLE"}

   PHASE 2 - Technology-Specific Analysis:
   {f"- tfsec: {'/home/jimmie/bin/tfsec'} (Terraform security)" if 'tfsec' in available_tools else "- tfsec: NOT AVAILABLE"}
   {f"- checkov: {'/home/jimmie/.local/bin/checkov'} (Multi-cloud IaC)" if 'checkov' in available_tools else "- checkov: NOT AVAILABLE"}
   {f"- kubescape: {'/home/jimmie/bin/kubescape'} (K8s CKS security)" if 'kubescape' in available_tools else "- kubescape: NOT AVAILABLE"}
   {f"- bandit: {'/home/jimmie/.local/bin/bandit'} (Python security)" if 'bandit' in available_tools else "- bandit: NOT AVAILABLE"}

   PHASE 3 - Comprehensive Coverage:
   {f"- semgrep: {'/home/jimmie/bin/semgrep'} (Multi-language SAST)" if 'semgrep' in available_tools else "- semgrep: NOT AVAILABLE"}
   {f"- trivy: {'/home/jimmie/bin/trivy'} (Container vulnerabilities)" if 'trivy' in available_tools else "- trivy: NOT AVAILABLE"}

3. **KNOWLEDGE CORRELATION PHASE**
   Cross-reference findings with security knowledge:
   - CIS Benchmarks for relevant technologies
   - OWASP Top 10 and security patterns
   - Kubernetes Security best practices
   - Cloud provider security guidelines
   - Industry-specific compliance requirements

4. **RISK PRIORITIZATION PHASE**
   Prioritize vulnerabilities by:
   - Business impact severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Exploitability and attack vectors
   - Compliance framework violations
   - Client industry risk factors

5. **REMEDIATION GENERATION PHASE**
   Generate specific, actionable fixes:
   - Code patches for identified vulnerabilities
   - OPA policies to prevent future issues
   - Infrastructure-as-Code improvements
   - CI/CD pipeline security enhancements
   - Monitoring and detection rules

6. **CLIENT-READY DELIVERABLE**
   Format as professional security assessment:
   - Executive Summary with business impact
   - Technical findings with evidence
   - Prioritized remediation roadmap
   - Compliance gap analysis
   - Implementation timeline and costs

ANALYSIS PARAMETERS:
- If {analysis_depth} == "quick": Focus on critical/high severity only, limit to 15-minute analysis
- If {analysis_depth} == "focused": Target specific technology stack, 30-minute deep dive
- If {analysis_depth} == "comprehensive": Full multi-technology analysis, no time limits

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Present findings as a complete security consultation report that could be delivered directly to {client_name or 'the client'} leadership team.
