## New Clean Structure

```
GP-POL-AS-CODE/
├── 1-POLICIES/         # 📚 12 OPA policies + 2 Gatekeeper
├── 2-AUTOMATION/       # 🤖 5 Python tools (scanners/fixers/generators)
├── 3-STANDARDS/        # 🏢 GuidePoint production (280 lines OPA + 750 Terraform)
├── 4-DOCS/             # 📖 8 documentation files
└── README.md           # Main documentation

13 directories, 28 files (no duplicates)
```

---

## Verification

**Test structure:**
```bash
cd /home/jimmie/linkops-industries/GP-copilot/GP-CONSULTING-AGENTS/GP-POL-AS-CODE
tree -L 2 -I '__pycache__|*.pyc|*.bak*' --dirsfirst
```

**Expected output:**
- ✅ Only numbered directories (1-POLICIES, 2-AUTOMATION, 3-STANDARDS, 4-DOCS)
- ✅ No old directories (scanners, fixers, etc.)
- ✅ Clean structure with README.md at root

---

## Benefits

1. **No Confusion:** Single location for each file type
2. **Clear Purpose:** Numbered directories show hierarchy
3. **Agent-Ready:** Tools in 2-AUTOMATION/ ready for PolicyAgent
4. **Production-Ready:** GuidePoint standards isolated in 3-STANDARDS/
5. **Well-Documented:** All docs in 4-DOCS/

---

## Next Actions

- ✅ Directory cleanup complete
- ✅ README.md updated with new structure
- ✅ PolicyAgent created in GP-PLATFORM/coordination/
- ⏳ DeepSeek-Coder testing (model loading)
- ⏸️ Ready for production use
