## Section 1: IaC Security - Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Mitigation Strategies

IaC security involves embedding controls into templates to prevent vulnerabilities like misconfigurations, exposed secrets, or over-privileged resources from reaching production. Common risks include hard-coded credentials, unencrypted data, public exposures, and supply chain attacks on modules/providers.

### Common IaC Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Misconfigurations**: Overly permissive IAM roles, public S3 buckets, or open security groups leading to data breaches.
2. **Secrets Exposure**: Hard-coded API keys, passwords in code repositories.
3. **Supply Chain Risks**: Malicious modules from registries or unverified providers.
4. **Drift and Shadow IT**: Manual changes bypassing IaC, creating untracked vulnerabilities.
5. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Outdated libraries or providers with known CVEs.
6. **Privilege Escalation**: Excessive permissions in resources allowing lateral movement.
7. **Compliance Violations**: Failure to enforce encryption, logging, or tagging for regulations like GDPR/HIPAA.

### IaC Security Mitigation Strategies
- **Shift-Left Security**: Integrate scanning in IDEs (e.g., VS Code plugins for tfsec/Checkov) and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Secrets Management**: Use tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault; avoid plain text—reference dynamically.
- **Static Analysis**: Run tools like Terrascan, tfsec, or Checkov to detect misconfigs pre-commit.
- **Least Privilege**: Enforce IAM policies with minimal permissions; use OPA for automated checks.
- **Version Pinning**: Lock module/provider versions; scan for vulnerabilities with tools like Trivy.
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Rebuild rather than patch; use blue-green deployments.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Enable CloudTrail/GuardDuty; detect drifts with terraform refresh/plan.
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify risks via STRIDE model; incorporate into IaC design reviews.

| Terrascan | Compliance & vulnerability    | Custom Rego policies              | OPA-based engine                 | Enforce encryption on resources  |
| Trivy     | Dependency scanning           | CVE detection in modules/providers| Pipeline integration             | Scan for outdated providers      |
| Snyk IaC  | Cloud-native security         | Fix suggestions                   | TF support; policy as code       | Supply chain risk assessment     |

### Real-World IaC Security Example
In a 2025 breach analysis, exposed S3 buckets via IaC misconfigs led to data leaks; mitigated by OPA policies enforcing private ACLs and encryption.

## Section 2: Terraform Security - Best Practices, Features, and Secure Configurations

Terraform security in 2025 emphasizes foundational practices like module verification, API access controls, and secrets omission from state. New features include AI-powered productivity in HCP Terraform for secure scaling.

### Core Terraform Security Best Practices (2025 Edition)
1. **Verify Modules/Providers**: Use signed modules from Terraform Registry; pin versions to avoid supply chain attacks.
2. **Access Controls**: Use short-lived credentials (OIDC with GitHub Actions); least-privilege IAM roles.
3. **Secrets Handling**: Use `sensitive = true` for outputs; integrate Vault/Secrets Manager for dynamic injection.
4. **State Security**: Encrypt remote state (S3 with KMS); use DynamoDB locking; enable versioning/backups.
5. **Pre-Apply Checks**: Integrate OPA/Sentinel for policy enforcement; run tfsec/Checkov in pipelines.
6. **Immutable Resources**: Use lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true } for critical resources.
7. **Auditing**: Enable detailed logging; use HCP Terraform for centralized governance.
8. **Drift Detection**: Schedule `terraform plan` in CI/CD; remediate with refresh/import.
9. **Multi-Env Separation**: Use workspaces or directories; apply RBAC in HCP.
10. **Dependency Management**: Scan with Trivy; use `required_providers` with hashes.

### Secure Terraform HCL Examples
Prevent public S3:
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
  acl    = "private"  # Enforce private
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```
IAM Least Privilege:
```
resource "aws_iam_role" "least_priv" {
  name = "secure-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = { Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com" }
    }]
  })
}
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "minimal" {
  role = aws_iam_role.least_priv.name
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action   = ["s3:GetObject"]
      Effect   = "Allow"
      Resource = "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }]
  })
}
```
State Encryption Backend:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "secure-state"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform"
    dynamodb_table = "state-lock"
  }
}
```

### Secure Folder Structure
```
terraform/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/ (vars.tf with dev IAM)
│   │   └── main.tf (inherits secure modules)
│   └── prod/ (strict policies)
├── modules/
│   └── secure_vpc/ (enforces private subnets)
│       ├── main.tf
│       └── variables.tf (sensitive vars)
└── policies/ (OPA Rego files)
    └── security.rego
```

## Section 3: Policy as Code for Security Enforcement with OPA

PaC with OPA codifies security rules (e.g., no public resources, mandatory encryption) for automated enforcement in CI/CD, preventing breaches. In 2025, OPA integrates deeply with HCP Terraform for compliance at scale.

### Benefits for Security
- **Preventive Controls**: Block insecure deploys (e.g., unencrypted DBs) pre-production.
- **Audit Trails**: Version policies; trace violations.
- **Scalability**: Enforce across multi-cloud; integrate with Terraform plans.
- **Compliance Automation**: Map to CIS benchmarks, PCI-DSS.

### Security Use Cases
- Enforce no public IPs in EC2.
- Require MFA on IAM users.
- Mandate KMS encryption for storage.

## Section 4: OPA Rego for Terraform Security - Advanced Examples and Integrations

OPA uses Rego to evaluate Terraform JSON plans against security policies, denying insecure changes. 2025 updates include stricter type safety and partial evaluation for efficiency.

### Advanced Rego Security Policies for Terraform
1. **Enforce Encryption on S3**:
   ```
   package terraform.aws.s3
   import input.tfplan as tfplan
   violation contains msg if {
       r := tfplan.resource_changes[_]
       r.type == "aws_s3_bucket"
       actions := r.change.actions
       "create" in actions or "update" in actions
       not r.change.after.server_side_encryption_configuration
       msg := sprintf("S3 bucket %v must have encryption enabled", [r.address])
   }
   ```

2. **Deny Public Security Groups**:
   ```
   package terraform.security_groups
   import input.tfplan as tfplan
   deny contains msg if {
       sg := tfplan.resource_changes[_]
       sg.type == "aws_security_group"
       ingress := sg.change.after.ingress[_]
       ingress.cidr_blocks[_] == "0.0.0.0/0"
       ingress.from_port == 0
       ingress.to_port == 0
       msg := sprintf("Security group %v has open ingress", [sg.address])
   }
   ```

3. **Require Tags for Compliance**:
   ```
   package terraform.tags
   import input.tfplan as tfplan
   required_tags := ["Environment", "Owner"]
   violation contains msg if {
       r := tfplan.resource_changes[_]
       "create" in r.change.actions
       missing := {tag | tag := required_tags[_]; not tag in object.keys(r.change.after.tags)}
       count(missing) > 0
       msg := sprintf("Resource %v missing tags: %v", [r.address, missing])
   }
   ```

4. **Blast Radius Limit with IAM Check**:
   ```
   package terraform.analysis
   import input.tfplan as tfplan
   max_changes := 50
   deny contains msg if {
       changes := count(tfplan.resource_changes)
       changes > max_changes
       msg := sprintf("Plan exceeds %v changes: %v", [max_changes, changes])
   }
   deny contains msg if {
       r := tfplan.resource_changes[_]
       r.type like "aws_iam_*"
       msg := sprintf("IAM changes require approval: %v", [r.address])
   }
   ```

### OPA-Terraform Integration Tutorial (Security Focus)
1. Convert plan: `terraform show -json tfplan.tfplan > plan.json`
2. Eval: `opa eval -i plan.json -d security.rego data.terraform.violation`
3. CI/CD: Use in GitHub Actions with OIDC for secure AWS access.
4. HCP: Upload Rego to OPA framework for cloud enforcement.

## Section 5: Advanced Security Patterns and Threat Models

### Common Attack Vectors in IaC
1. **Configuration Drift**: Attackers modify resources outside IaC to bypass security controls
2. **State File Compromise**: Exposed terraform.tfstate reveals infrastructure secrets and topology
3. **Module Poisoning**: Malicious code in public registries executing during apply
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Over-privileged service accounts in CI/CD pipelines
5. **Plan Manipulation**: Intercepted terraform plans revealing sensitive information

### Security-First Design Patterns
1. **Defense in Depth**: Layer multiple security controls (WAF + SG + NACLs)
2. **Zero Trust Networks**: No implicit trust; verify everything
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace rather than modify
5. **Secrets Rotation**: Automated credential lifecycle management

### GP-Copilot Integration Points
When GP-Copilot encounters these security patterns:

#### Terraform Security Violations
- **CKV_AWS_20** (Public S3): Generate private bucket configuration with encryption
- **CKV_AWS_21** (S3 Versioning): Add versioning block to bucket resource
- **CKV_AWS_144** (S3 Replication): Recommend cross-region backup strategy
- **TF_AWS_001** (Security Groups): Analyze and restrict CIDR blocks

#### OPA Policy Violations
- **terraform.aws.s3.violation**: Generate compliant S3 configuration
- **terraform.security_groups.deny**: Provide least-privilege security group rules
- **terraform.tags.violation**: Auto-generate required tag blocks
- **terraform.analysis.deny**: Break down large changes into smaller deployments

#### Trivy Infrastructure Findings
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate escalation with secure alternatives
- **HIGH**: Automated fix generation where possible
- **MEDIUM**: Scheduled remediation with risk assessment
- **LOW**: Include in next maintenance cycle

#### Integration with Scanning Workflow
1. **Pre-scan Analysis**: Jade reviews file types and suggests appropriate scanners
2. **Result Correlation**: Cross-reference findings between tools (Checkov + TFSec + OPA)
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate blast radius and criticality
4. **Remediation Planning**: Generate step-by-step fix procedures
5. **Compliance Mapping**: Link violations to frameworks (CIS, NIST, SOC2)
