## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### September 30, 2025
- **Decision:** Stick with monolithic architecture (not microservices)
- **Rationale:** Desktop app, offline operation, simpler deployment
- **Impact:** All phases build on single codebase

### Architecture Principles:
1. **Local-first:** Everything runs on manager's machine
2. **Offline:** No cloud dependencies after installation
3. **Fast:** Sub-2 second response for any query
4. **Simple:** One installer, one process, one database
