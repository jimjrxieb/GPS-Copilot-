**Scanners (Trivy, Checkov, Bandit) - Reactive Detection:**
- Run AFTER code/configs are written
- Find vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- Generate reports highlighting issues
- Don't block deployment - just inform

**Gatekeeper - Proactive Prevention:**
- Runs BEFORE resources are deployed to Kubernetes
- Actively PREVENTS bad configurations from being created
- Real-time policy enforcement at API server level
- Acts as admission control gatekeeper

🏗️ **Perfect Analogy:**
Scanners = TSA checking your luggage after you packed it
Gatekeeper = Bouncer at exclusive club checking credentials at the door

**🎯 Interview Key Point:** "Gatekeeper is policy enforcement at deployment time, not vulnerability scanning of existing code."

```
kubectl apply → API Server → Admission Controllers → etcd

                           [Gatekeeper Webhook] → OPA Policy Evaluation
```

**How Gatekeeper Integrates:**
Runs as ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
1. You try to create/update a resource
2. K8s API server consults Gatekeeper before allowing it
3. Gatekeeper evaluates OPA/Rego policies
4. Returns allow/deny decision
5. API server creates resource or rejects it

**Technical Implementation:**
- Pod in `gatekeeper-system` namespace
- Uses ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
- Evaluates policies with OPA engine + Rego
- Only affects NEW/UPDATED resources

*LangGraph workflow leveraging your comprehensive knowledge base*"""

    def _create_constraint_template_response(self):

**ConstraintTemplate: The Policy Blueprint**
- Defines reusable policy templates
- Contains Rego code for policy logic
- Think: "class" in programming

**Constraint: The Policy Instance**
- Uses ConstraintTemplate as foundation
- Specifies which resources to apply policy to
- Sets specific enforcement parameters
- Think: "object" instantiated from class

**Workflow:**
1. Create ConstraintTemplate with Rego policy
2. Create Constraint using that template
3. Gatekeeper enforces on resource operations

**Key Insight:** Templates enable policy reuse across different resource types while maintaining consistent enforcement logic.

*Powered by LangGraph state management + your Gatekeeper knowledge*"""

    def _create_opa_gatekeeper_response(self):
        return """🤖 **OPA vs Gatekeeper: Engine vs Integration**

**OPA (Open Policy Agent) - The Brain:**
- General-purpose policy engine
- Evaluates policies against any structured data
- Uses Rego language for policy definition
- Not Kubernetes-specific

**Gatekeeper - The Kubernetes Integration:**
- Kubernetes-native wrapper around OPA
- Provides CRDs (ConstraintTemplates, Constraints)
- Handles admission webhook lifecycle
- Adds audit, violation reporting, status tracking

**Why Both Are Needed:**
OPA alone requires custom integration work. Gatekeeper provides native K8s resource management, automatic webhook management, and policy template reusability.

**Interview Analogy:** OPA is like PostgreSQL (powerful engine), Gatekeeper is like Django (framework that makes the engine easy to use).
