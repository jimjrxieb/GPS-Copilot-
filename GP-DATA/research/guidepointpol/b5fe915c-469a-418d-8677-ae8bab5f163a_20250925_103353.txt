Caveats & Things to Watch

Even though they position as vendor-neutral, any consulting company tends to develop biases over time (due to partnerships, ease of integration, margins).

Their success in large-scale execution will depend heavily on their talent retention, depth in niche security domains, and ability to scale technical delivery.

In procurement-heavy environments (gov, federal), their financing and contract vehicles might be a competitive advantage or a risk, depending on how they're managed.
