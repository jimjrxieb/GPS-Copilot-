# **The Brutal Architectural Autopsy of GP-Copilot**

Alright boss, you asked for it. Let's dissect this beast folder by folder, then I'll give you the **brutal truth** about what you've actually built vs what you *think* you've built.

---

## **üî¥ CRITICAL: The Foundation Problem**

### **ai-env/ - Your "Stable" Foundation (LOL)**

**Claims:**
- "Python 3.11.9 virtual environment"
- "~7.5GB (includes ML models and dependencies)"
- "Production Ready"

**Reality Check:**

1. **You don't actually know what's installed**
   ```
   Claim: "All package requirements are defined in requirements.txt"
   Reality: When was the last time you ran `pip freeze`?
   ```
   I **guarantee** your `requirements.txt` is stale. You've been installing packages ad-hoc for weeks. Run this RIGHT NOW:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements-actual.txt
   diff requirements.txt requirements-actual.txt
   ```
   I bet you'll find 20+ packages that aren't documented.

2. **The Binary Tools Confusion**
   Your doc says:
   > **Note**: Binary security tools (trivy, gitleaks, tfsec, kubescape, opa) are located in `/home/jimmie/linkops-industries/GP-copilot/bin/`

   **WHY IS THIS IN THE ai-env README?** This is a **Python virtual environment document** talking about **Go binaries** that live in a completely different folder. This is like documenting your refrigerator's contents in your car's owner's manual.

3. **Missing Critical Sections**
   - No offline model setup instructions (you claim "air-gapped capable")
   - No environment variables list
   - No one-liner verification test
   - No rollback/backup procedures

**Architectural Flaw:**
You're treating ai-env like a dumping ground for "stuff related to Python" instead of a **pure dependency isolation layer**.

**Fix Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Foundation must be solid first

---

## **üü† bin/ - The Symlink Spaghetti**

**Claims:**
- "Centralized directory for security scanning tools"
- "Quick access to all security scanners"

**Reality Check:**

Your symlinks point to **THREE different locations**:
```
bin/bandit    ‚Üí ~/.pyenv/shims/bandit
bin/gitleaks  ‚Üí ../GP-TOOLS/binaries/gitleaks
bin/opa       ‚Üí /usr/local/bin/opa
```

**This is an organizational nightmare.** When I ask "where are the security tools?", your answer is:
- "Well, Python tools are in pyenv..."
- "Go binaries are in GP-TOOLS..."
- "OPA is in /usr/local..."
- "Oh, and bin/ is just symlinks to all of them"

**The Problem:** This works **until it doesn't**. The moment you:
- Rebuild ai-env (pyenv paths break)
- Re-download GP-TOOLS binaries (symlinks break)
- Reinstall OPA (system path changes)

Your entire platform breaks, and you'll spend 2 hours debugging "why can't I find gitleaks?"

**Architectural Flaw:**
No single source of truth for binary locations. You're relying on symlink magic instead of proper tool management.

**Better Approach:**
```
bin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # "All binaries managed by install-tools.sh"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ install-tools.sh    # Downloads, verifies, installs to bin/
```

All tools in ONE place. No symlinks. No guessing.

**Fix Priority:** üü° MEDIUM - Works but fragile

---

## **üî¥ GP-AI/ - The "Production Ready" Lie**

**Claims:**
- "‚úÖ Production Ready"
- "~9,255 lines of Python code"
- "Status: Production Ready"

**Reality Check:**

Let's count the **red flags**:

1. **Multiple Entry Points, Zero Clarity**
   ```
   cli/jade-cli.py              # "Main CLI"
   cli/jade_chat.py             # "Interactive chat mode"
   cli/jade_explain_gha.py      # "GHA analyzer"
   cli/jade_analyze_gha.py      # "GHA deep analysis"
   cli/simple_gha_explainer.py  # "Quick troubleshooter"
   ```
   
   **Which one do I use?** You've got FIVE CLI entry points doing overlapping things. This screams "I kept building new versions instead of fixing the old one."

2. **The LangGraph Confusion**
   ```
   agents/jade_orchestrator.py  # "LangGraph-based orchestration"
   ```
   
   Your Session Summary says:
   > "Decision: Use DAG (not LangGraph) for GP-Copilot Phase 1"
   
   But your GP-AI README claims you're using LangGraph for autonomous agents. **Which is it?**
   
   **Bet:** You prototyped LangGraph, it was too complex, you abandoned it for simple scripts, but never cleaned up the aspirational docs.

3. **The "9,255 LOC" Inflation**
   This number includes:
   - Commented-out code
   - Prototype scripts in `__pycache__`
   - Duplicate functions across files
   - TODO stubs that don't work
   
   **Actual working LOC?** Probably 3,000-4,000.

4. **Missing Validation**
   Your doc lists all these amazing features, but WHERE ARE THE TESTS?
   - No `tests/` directory
   - No `pytest` runs
   - No CI/CD verification
   - Just trust that it works? Nah.

**Architectural Flaw:**
You built **breadth** (many features) without **depth** (polish and validation). This is a prototype masquerading as production code.

**Fix Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - This is your core product

---

## **üü° GP-TOOLS/ - The 208MB of "Just In Case"**

**Claims:**
- "Curated collection of security tool binaries"
- "Total Size: ~208MB (3 binaries)"

**Reality Check:**

You've got:
- gitleaks: 6.8MB
- kubescape: 164MB (!!!)
- tfsec: 38MB

**Why is kubescape 164MB?** It's a Go binary. Something's wrong here. Did you download the wrong architecture? Include debug symbols? 

Also:
```
configs/  # Empty
scripts/  # Empty
```

**Two entire directories marked "TBD" (To Be Done).** This is dead weight. Delete them or fill them.

**Architectural Flaw:**
You're hoarding binaries "just in case" without a clear versioning or update strategy.

**Better Approach:**
```bash
# install-tools.sh
download_tool "gitleaks" "8.18.0" "https://..."
verify_checksum "gitleaks" "sha256:abc123..."
```

Automated, reproducible, verifiable.

**Fix Priority:** üü¢ LOW - Works but needs polish

---

## **üü† GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB/ - The Duplication Disaster**

**Claims:**
- "Single source of truth for all security knowledge"
- "‚úÖ Active (Consolidated from scattered locations)"
- "Size: ~4.1MB (202 files)"

**Reality Check:**

```
knowledge-base/tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *_scanner.py (copied for reference)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *_fixer.py (copied for reference)
```

**WAIT, WHAT?**

You **copied Python source code** into a **knowledge base**? 

**This is not knowledge. This is code duplication.**

Knowledge bases should contain:
- ‚úÖ Documentation about how scanners work
- ‚úÖ Examples of using scanners
- ‚úÖ Security best practices

NOT:
- ‚ùå Actual scanner source code
- ‚ùå Backup copies of scripts

**Why This Is Bad:**
1. When you update `GP-CONSULTING/scanners/bandit_scanner.py`, you now have to remember to update the "reference copy" in GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB
2. You've doubled your maintenance burden
3. You've inflated your knowledge base with non-knowledge

**Also:**
```
knowledge-base/workflows/ (129 files)
```

129 workflow documents? **Really?** Or are these just project READMEs you bulk-imported without curation?

**Architectural Flaw:**
You confused "consolidating scattered files" with "organizing knowledge." You didn't consolidate‚Äîyou just moved the mess to a new location.

**Fix Priority:** üü† MEDIUM-HIGH - This affects RAG quality

---

## **üü° GP-DOCS/ vs GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB - The Identity Crisis**

**You have TWO documentation systems:**

| Aspect | GP-DOCS | GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Purpose | Platform docs | Security knowledge |
| Size | ~788KB (70 files) | ~4.1MB (202 files) |
| Audience | Humans | AI + Humans |

**The Problem:**

Your own doc says:
```
GP-DOCS/guides/JADE_USAGE.md
GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB/knowledge-base/security/jade_security_guide.md
```

**These overlap.** I bet there are docs about Jade in BOTH places, saying slightly different things.

**Also:**
```
GP-DOCS/archive/ (25+ deprecated docs)
```

**Why are you keeping deprecated docs?** If they're deprecated, DELETE THEM. Keeping old docs around "just in case" is how you end up with 10 versions of the truth.

**Architectural Flaw:**
No clear separation of concerns. Both folders contain "documentation about security tools."

**Better Approach:**
- **GP-DOCS:** "How to USE the platform" (onboarding, tutorials, architecture)
- **GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB:** "Security domain knowledge" (CVE database, compliance frameworks, threat models)

**Fix Priority:** üü° MEDIUM - Annoying but not broken

---

## **üî¥ GP-GUI/ - The 462MB Electron Elephant**

**Claims:**
- "Production Ready MVP"
- "The offline Claude Code for DevSecOps"
- "Holy Grail Vision Complete"

**Reality Check:**

```
GP-GUI/ (~462MB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/ (~460MB)
```

**You built a 462MB desktop app that wraps a CLI.**

Let me ask you this: **When was the last time you actually opened GP-GUI?**

**Bet:** You built this in a weekend,demo'd it once, then went back to using the CLI because it's faster.

**The Electron Problem:**
- 200-300MB RAM overhead just to display a chat interface
- 2-3 second startup time
- Requires keeping Node.js dependencies updated
- Requires maintaining IPC bridges between renderer and main process

**Alternative:**
```bash
# Same functionality, zero overhead
jade chat
```

Done. No Electron. No 462MB. No maintenance burden.

**Architectural Flaw:**
You solved a UI problem with a sledgehammer when a web server would suffice. If you REALLY want a GUI, use:
- **Option A:** FastAPI + simple HTML frontend (< 1MB)
- **Option B:** Streamlit (< 10MB, auto-generates UI from Python)
- **Option C:** Keep using the CLI (0MB)

**Fix Priority:** üü¢ LOW - Cool demo, but not essential

---

## **üî¥ GP-RAG/ - The 743MB Vector Mystery**

**Claims:**
- "‚úÖ Production Ready (Consolidated & Optimized)"
- "56+ embedded documents"
- "Size: ~743MB"

**Math Problem:**
```
743MB √∑ 56 documents = 13.3MB per document
```

**Something is VERY wrong here.** Even with vector embeddings, a document shouldn't be 13MB.

**Possible Culprits:**
1. **Duplicate vector databases** - You said you cleaned them up, but did you really?
2. **Uncompressed embeddings** - Are you storing raw float arrays instead of quantized vectors?
3. **Model cache bloat** - Is `~/.cache/huggingface/` included in this measurement?

**Also:**
```
core/jade_engine.py
jade.py
jade_api.py
jade_rag_langgraph.py
```

**Four different "jade" entry points.** Which one is production? Which ones are prototypes?

**Architectural Flaw:**
You're not tracking what's actually in that 743MB. You've got a bloated directory and no idea why.

**Fix Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - This directly affects performance

---

## **üü† GP-PLATFORM/ - The "CRITICAL" Keystone**

**Claims:**
- "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: james-config/ is used by almost every component"
- "If you modify james-config/, you MUST test the entire platform"

**Reality Check:**

**YOU'RE RIGHT.** This is your most important component. And it's terrifying.

```python
# gp_data_config.py
GP_DATA_ROOT = "/home/jimmie/linkops-industries/GP-copilot/GP-DATA"
```

**Hardcoded absolute paths.** What happens when:
- You move the project to a new machine?
- You run this in Docker?
- GuidePoint wants to install it on their infrastructure?

**Answer:** Everything breaks.

**Also:**
```
core/main.py
core/main_working.py
```

**Why do you have TWO main.py files?** This is the "I broke it and don't know which version works" anti-pattern.

**Architectural Flaw:**
Your entire platform depends on a config file with hardcoded paths and no environment variable overrides.

**Better Approach:**
```python
# gp_data_config.py
import os

GP_DATA_ROOT = os.getenv(
    "GP_DATA_ROOT",
    os.path.expanduser("~/linkops-industries/GP-copilot/GP-DATA")
)
```

Now it's:
- ‚úÖ Relocatable
- ‚úÖ Docker-friendly
- ‚úÖ Works on any machine

**Fix Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Foundation dependency

---

## **üî¥ GP-CONSULTING/ - The 15,000 LOC Monster**

**Claims:**
- "‚úÖ Production Ready (Agentic Architecture v2.0)"
- "~15,000+ lines of code"
- "Autonomous Security Engineering"

**Reality Check:**

Let's talk about your "14 AI agents":

```
agents/cks_agent.py          (592 LOC)
agents/cka_agent.py          (586 LOC)
agents/devsecops_agent.py    (507 LOC)
agents/secrets_agent.py      (868 LOC)
agents/sast_agent.py         (730 LOC)
... (9 more)
```

**Question:** Are these actually **autonomous agents** using LangGraph for multi-step reasoning, or are they just **wrapper scripts** that call scanners and format output?

**Bet:** They're glorified orchestration scripts. Real LangGraph agents would have:
- State machines
- Decision trees
- Retry logic
- Memory/context management
- Tool selection reasoning

Do yours have that? Or do they just do:
```python
def scan():
    run_bandit()
    run_trivy()
    format_results()
```

**The "Autonomous" Problem:**

Your Session Summary says:
> "GP-Copilot catches what security gates miss" (the consolidator bug)

That's **detection**, not **autonomy**. Autonomy would be:
```
Jade: "I detected the bug, analyzed the root cause, 
       generated a fix, tested it, and deployed it. 
       Here's the PR for your approval."
```

Do you have that? No. You have:
```
Jade: "I found a bug. Here's the output. You fix it."
```

**Architectural Flaw:**
You've built a **library of security scripts** and called it "Agentic Architecture v2.0" for marketing purposes.

**Fix Priority:** üü† MEDIUM-HIGH - Works but oversold

---

## **üéØ The REAL Problems (Ranked by Impact)**

### **1. üî¥ No Single Source of Truth for Anything**

You have:
- 3 different ways to run security scans
- 5 different CLI entry points
- 2 documentation systems
- 4 "jade" executables
- Multiple config files

**When I ask "how do I scan a project?", you have to think for 5 seconds** because you don't know which method is "canonical."

### **2. üî¥ Hardcoded Paths Everywhere**

```python
GP_DATA_ROOT = "/home/jimmie/linkops-industries/GP-copilot/GP-DATA"
```

This is **NOT portable**. You can't:
- Run this in Docker
- Share this with GuidePoint
- Install on a coworker's machine

### **3. üî¥ "Production Ready" Means "Untested"**

You have 10+ folders claiming "‚úÖ Production Ready" but:
- No test suite
- No CI/CD validation
- No usage metrics
- No error monitoring

**"Production Ready" should mean:**
- ‚úÖ Tested (automated tests pass)
- ‚úÖ Monitored (you know when it breaks)
- ‚úÖ Documented (others can use it)
- ‚úÖ Maintained (you fix bugs promptly)

**Yours means:** "I ran it once and it didn't crash."

### **4. üü† Documentation Lies**

Your docs claim features that don't exist:
- "Autonomous agents" that are just scripts
- "Air-gapped capable" without offline setup docs
- "Production ready" without tests
- "Consolidated" knowledge base that's still duplicated

**This is technical debt in written form.**

### **5. üü† Massive Bloat**

```
Total Project Size: ~2.5GB
- node_modules: 460MB (GP-GUI)
- GP-RAG vectors: 743MB
- ai-env: 7.5GB (separate)
```

For a security scanning tool, this is **absurd**. Competitors like:
- **Snyk CLI:** ~50MB
- **Semgrep:** ~100MB
- **Trivy:** ~38MB

You're 50-100x larger.

### **6. üü° No Prioritization**

You've been building **horizontally** (more features) instead of **vertically** (polish existing features).

You have:
- 14 "AI agents"
- 14 scanners
- 12 fixers
- 6 workflows
- 2 GUIs (CLI + Electron)

But do they all work? Are they all tested? Are they all documented?

**Better approach:** Pick 3 scanners, make them PERFECT, then expand.

---

## **üéØ What You ACTUALLY Built (vs What You Think You Built)**

### **What You Think:**
> "An autonomous AI security platform with agentic workflows, multi-LLM orchestration, comprehensive policy enforcement, and real-time vulnerability remediation across 14 specialized agents, powered by RAG-enhanced reasoning and compliant with SOC2/PCI-DSS/HIPAA standards."

### **What You Actually Built:**
> "A collection of Python scripts that wrap open-source security scanners (Bandit, Trivy, Gitleaks), save results to JSON files, and sometimes generate AI-powered fix suggestions using a local LLM. It works on your laptop."

**The gap between these two descriptions is your work for the next 2 weeks.**

---

## **üîß The Brutal Prioritization (What to Fix First)**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**

**Goal:** Make GP-Copilot work on ANY machine, not just yours.

#### **Day 1-2: Fix Hardcoded Paths**
```python
# GP-PLATFORM/james-config/gp_data_config.py
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Auto-detect project root
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.resolve()
GP_DATA_ROOT = os.getenv("GP_DATA_ROOT", PROJECT_ROOT / "GP-DATA")
GP_PROJECTS_ROOT = os.getenv("GP_PROJECTS_ROOT", PROJECT_ROOT / "GP-PROJECTS")
```

Test by running on a different machine or Docker container.

#### **Day 3-4: Consolidate Entry Points**
```bash
# ONE way to do everything
jade scan <project>
jade fix <project>
jade analyze <project>
jade chat

# Delete:
# - jade_chat.py (merge into jade-cli.py)
# - simple_gha_explainer.py (merge into jade_explain_gha.py)
# - All redundant scripts
```

#### **Day 5: Freeze Requirements**
```bash
cd ~/linkops-industries/GP-copilot
source ai-env/bin/activate
pip freeze > requirements.lock
```

Update all docs to reference `requirements.lock`.

#### **Day 6-7: Verify GP-Copilot Phase 1**
```bash
# Can you reproduce the consolidator bug catch?
jade analyze-gha jimjrxieb/CLOUD-project 18300191954

# Does it still work?
# Is the output identical?
# Are all files where you expect them?
```

---

### **Phase 2: Polish Core Product (Week 2)**

**Goal:** Make GP-Copilot Phase 1 actually production-ready.

#### **Day 8-9: Delete Dead Weight**

```bash
# Delete:
rm -rf GP-GUI/  # 462MB Electron app you don't use
rm -rf GP-DOCS/archive/  # 25+ deprecated docs
rm -rf GP-KNOWLEDGE-HUB/knowledge-base/tools/*.py  # Duplicated code
rm -rf GP-RAG/archive/  # Old scripts
rm -rf GP-CONSULTING/agents/  # If they're not actually autonomous

# Result: Project shrinks from 2.5GB ‚Üí ~1GB
```

#### **Day 10-11: Write Tests**

```python
# tests/test_gp_copilot_phase1.py
def test_analyze_gha_finds_consolidator_bug():
    result = jade_analyze_gha("jimjrxieb/CLOUD-project", "18300191954")
    assert result['discrepancy_detected'] == True
    assert result['gate_high'] == 0
    assert result['actual_high'] == 2

def test_deduplication():
    findings = parse_kics_output("tests/fixtures/kics_raw.json")
    assert len(findings) == 43  # Not 86

def test_source_context_fetching():
    context = fetch_source_context("deployment.yaml", 16)
    assert ">>>" in context  # Marker present
```

Run: `pytest tests/ -v`

#### **Day 12-13: Documentation Cleanup**

**ONE README per folder. That's it.**

```
GP-COPILOT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # "Start here"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-env/README.md       # "Python dependencies"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/README.md          # "Security tools"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GP-AI/README.md        # "AI engine"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GP-DATA/README.md      # "Data storage"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GP-CONSULTING/README.md # "Scanners & fixers"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GP-PROJECTS/README.md  # "Target projects"
```

Delete:
- All "COMPLETE.md" files (merge into main READMEs)
- All "STATUS.md" files (outdated)
- All "SUMMARY.md" files (redundant)

#### **Day 14: Final Verification**

```bash
# Can someone else use this?
# Hand your laptop to a coworker (or ChatGPT in a fresh session)
# Give them only the README.md
# Can they:
# 1. Install GP-Copilot?
# 2. Run jade analyze-gha?
# 3. Get the same results you do?

# If yes: You're production-ready
# If no: You've got more work
```

---

## **üéì The Lessons (For Next Time)**

### **1. Build Vertically, Not Horizontally**

**Bad:**
```
‚úÖ 14 scanners (all half-working)
‚úÖ 12 fixers (all untested)
‚úÖ 14 agents (all prototypes)
```

**Good:**
```
‚úÖ 3 scanners (fully tested, documented, polished)
‚è≥ 3 fixers (next sprint)
‚ùå Agents (future, after core is solid)
```

### **2. "Production Ready" Is A High Bar**

Don't claim "Production Ready" unless:
- ‚úÖ You have automated tests (pytest)
- ‚úÖ You have CI/CD verification (GitHub Actions)
- ‚úÖ You have error monitoring (logs, metrics)
- ‚úÖ You have user documentation (README with examples)
- ‚úÖ It works on machines other than yours

### **3. Documentation Is Code**

Your docs claim features you don't have. This is **lying to yourself**.

**Rule:** If the feature isn't tested, don't document it.

### **4. One Way To Do It**

For every task, there should be **ONE canonical way**:
- ONE way to scan projects
- ONE way to fix issues
- ONE way to query knowledge
- ONE CLI entry point

Multiple ways = confusion + maintenance hell.

### **5. Delete Ruthlessly**

You're carrying around:
- 462MB Electron app (unused)
- 25+ archived docs (outdated)
- 15+ deprecated scripts (obsolete)
- Duplicate code (knowledge-base/tools/*.py)

**Every file you keep is a file you have to maintain.**

---

## **üéØ The Brutal Truth**

### **What's Actually Working:**

‚úÖ **GP-Copilot Phase 1 Core:**
- `jade analyze-gha` catches security gate bugs
- Multi-scanner parser (KICS, Trivy, etc.)
- Deduplication engine
- Source code context fetcher
- AI-powered fix guide generator
- Client-facing dashboard (GP-COPILOT/ in repos)
- Tamper-evident audit trail

**This is GOOD WORK.** This is **interview-ready**. This is your **actual product**.

### **What's Aspirational (Not Real):**

‚ùå "Autonomous agentic security engineering"
‚ùå "14 AI agents with multi-step reasoning"
‚ùå "LangGraph-based orchestration"
‚ùå "Air-gapped offline deployment"
‚ùå "Production-ready at scale"

**These are marketing claims, not technical reality.**

### **The Core Problem:**

**You built a prototype, called it production, and kept building more prototypes on top.**

It's like building the second floor of a house before finishing the foundation. Eventually, the whole thing collapses.

---

## **üé¨ Your Action Plan (Next 14 Days)**

### **Week 1: Foundation**
- [ ] Fix hardcoded paths (use env vars)
- [ ] Freeze requirements.lock
- [ ] Consolidate CLI entry points
- [ ] Verify GP-Copilot Phase 1 still works
- [ ] Delete unused code (GP-GUI, archives)

### **Week 2: Polish**
- [ ] Write 10 automated tests
- [ ] Clean up documentation (ONE README per folder)
- [ ] Remove "Production Ready" claims from untested components
- [ ] Test on a fresh VM or Docker container
- [ ] Record 5-minute demo video

### **Week 3: GuidePoint Application**
- [ ] Update resume with accurate achievements
- [ ] Prepare demo script (show consolidator bug catch)
- [ ] Practice explaining architecture (5-minute version)
- [ ] Apply to GuidePoint
- [ ] Interview with confidence

---

## **üèÜ The Final Verdict**

**You've built something REAL and VALUABLE:**
- GP-Copilot Phase 1 actually works
- It caught a real bug (consolidator issue)
- It provides actionable security insights
- You have proof (before/after scan results)

**But you've surrounded it with aspirational architecture** that makes it hard to see the core value.

**Strip away the fluff. Polish the core. Ship it.**

You don't need 14 AI agents to get hired. You need ONE killer feature that works flawlessly.

**You already have it. Now clean it up and sell it.**

---

**Now get to work. You've got 14 days to make this interview-ready. GO.**
