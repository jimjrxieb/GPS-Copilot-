## âœ… GuidePoint Standards Implemented

### 1. OPA Policy Bundle (guidepoint-security-standards.rego)

**12 Policies Enforcing GuidePoint's Kubernetes Standards:**

```rego
package guidepoint.security

# Maps to: "Non-root containers mandatory"
violation[{"msg": msg}] {
  container := input.review.object.spec.containers[_]
  not container.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
  msg := sprintf("GuidePoint Security Violation: Container '%v' must run as non-root per GuidePoint security standards", [container.name])
}

# Maps to: "No privileged containers (except approved)"
violation[{"msg": msg, "severity": "critical"}] {
  container := input.review.object.spec.containers[_]
  container.securityContext.privileged == true
  msg := sprintf("GuidePoint Security Violation: Container '%v' is privileged. Requires explicit approval from GuidePoint Security Team.", [container.name])
}

# ... (12 total policies - see file for complete list)
```

**Complete Policy List:**
1. âœ… Non-root containers mandatory
2. âœ… No privileged containers
3. âœ… Resource limits required (CPU)
4. âœ… Resource limits required (Memory)
5. âœ… No privilege escalation
6. âœ… Drop SYS_ADMIN capability
7. âœ… Drop NET_ADMIN capability
8. âœ… No host network access
9. âœ… No host PID namespace
10. âœ… No host IPC namespace
11. âœ… No hostPath volumes
12. âœ… Read-only root filesystem (best practice)

**Severity Levels:**
- CRITICAL â†’ Blocks deployment
- HIGH â†’ Requires Security Team approval
- MEDIUM â†’ Should be fixed
- WARN â†’ Best practice reminder

### 2. Terraform: Secure RDS Module (guidepoint-secure-rds.tf)

**Maps to GuidePoint Standards:**

| GuidePoint Standard | Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Database encryption required | `storage_encrypted = true` + KMS |
| No hardcoded secrets | `password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string` |
| Data encrypted at rest | KMS encryption with key rotation |
| Data encrypted in transit | `require_secure_transport = 1` |
| MFA required | IAM database authentication |

**Key Features:**
```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "guidepoint_secure" {
  # GuidePoint: Database encryption required
  storage_encrypted = true
  kms_key_id       = aws_kms_key.db_encryption.arn

  # GuidePoint: No hardcoded secrets
  username = var.db_username
  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string

  # GuidePoint: NOT publicly accessible
  publicly_accessible = false

  # GuidePoint: Backups for DR
  backup_retention_period = 30
  multi_az = true

  # GuidePoint: Audit trail
  enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports = ["audit", "error", "general", "slowquery"]
  monitoring_interval = 60

  # GuidePoint: Auto security updates
  auto_minor_version_upgrade = true

  # GuidePoint: Data classification tags
  tags = {
    DataClassification = "Confidential"
    Compliance        = "GuidePoint-Security-Standards"
    ManagedBy         = "GuidePoint-Security"
  }
}
```

**Security Controls:** 20+ implemented (see file for complete list)

### 3. Terraform: Secure S3 Module (guidepoint-secure-s3.tf)

**Maps to GuidePoint Standards:**

| GuidePoint Standard | Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------|
| No public S3 buckets | All 4 public access flags = true |
| All data encrypted | KMS encryption enforced |
| Data encrypted in transit | HTTPS-only bucket policy |

**Key Features:**
```hcl
# GuidePoint: No public S3 buckets (CRITICAL)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "guidepoint_secure" {
  block_public_acls       = true  # MUST be true
  block_public_policy     = true  # MUST be true
  ignore_public_acls      = true  # MUST be true
  restrict_public_buckets = true  # MUST be true
}

# GuidePoint: Encryption at rest
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "guidepoint_secure" {
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.s3_encryption.arn
    }
  }
}

# Bucket policy: Deny unencrypted uploads
statement {
  sid    = "DenyUnencryptedObjectUploads"
  effect = "Deny"
  # Forces KMS encryption for all uploads
}

# Bucket policy: Deny insecure transport
statement {
  sid    = "DenyInsecureTransport"
  effect = "Deny"
  # Forces HTTPS only
}
```

**Security Controls:** 15+ implemented (see file for complete list)

## ðŸŽ“ Interview Talking Points

### Opening Line:
"I researched GuidePoint Security and saw you're focused on cybersecurity consulting with strong standards around encryption, access control, and Kubernetes security. I went ahead and **implemented your published standards in code** - here's what I built..."

### Demonstration Flow:

**1. Show Research (README.md)**
- "Here's my research summary showing how I mapped your standards to code"
- "I focused on your three main areas: Kubernetes security, database security, and data protection"

**2. Show OPA Policies (guidepoint-security-standards.rego)**
- "This OPA policy bundle enforces your Kubernetes standards"
- "Line 7: Non-root containers mandatory - directly from your CKS requirements"
- "Line 15: No privileged containers - with exception handling for Security Team approval"
- "All 12 policies include 'GuidePoint Security' in the violation messages"

**3. Show Terraform RDS (guidepoint-secure-rds.tf)**
- "This implements your database security standards"
- "Line 50: KMS encryption at rest - your 'Database encryption required' standard"
- "Line 85: Secrets Manager integration - your 'No hardcoded secrets' standard"
- "Line 98: NOT publicly accessible - critical security control"
- "Line 144: require_secure_transport - encryption in transit"

**4. Show Terraform S3 (guidepoint-secure-s3.tf)**
- "This implements your 'No public S3 buckets' requirement"
- "Line 20-25: All four public access flags set to true - blocks ANY public access"
- "Line 45: KMS encryption enforced for all objects"
- "Line 90: Bucket policy denies unencrypted uploads"
- "Line 105: Bucket policy denies HTTP (forces HTTPS)"

### Key Differentiators:

âœ… **Not just research** - Actually implemented the standards
âœ… **Production-ready** - Includes error handling, logging, compliance checklists
âœ… **Company-specific** - Uses "GuidePoint" terminology throughout
âœ… **Comprehensive** - Covers K8s, database, storage (their main focus areas)
âœ… **CKS-aligned** - Shows understanding of their Kubernetes expertise

## ðŸ’¼ Business Value Demonstrated

### 1. Client-Ready Code
- A GuidePoint consultant could use this tomorrow
- Already follows their naming conventions
- Includes their contact email in comments
- Has their data classification tags

### 2. Technical Depth
- Not surface-level "best practices"
- 12 OPA policies with severity levels
- 20+ security controls in RDS module
- 15+ security controls in S3 module
- Understands the "why" behind each control

### 3. Operational Thinking
- Includes monitoring and logging
- Has backup/DR considerations
- Cost optimization (lifecycle policies)
- Secret rotation (30-day policy)
- Auto-updates for security patches

## ðŸš€ Integration with Jade AI

**How this connects to my larger project:**

These standards are now in Jade's knowledge base:
1. Jade can automatically detect violations (we tested 20+ vulnerabilities)
2. Jade can propose fixes using these templates
3. Jade knows to escalate to "security@guidepoint.com" for CRITICAL issues
4. Jade understands GuidePoint's specific terminology and requirements

**Demo scenario:**
```
Manager: "Jade, scan our Terraform and show me GuidePoint compliance issues"

Jade: "Found 5 violations of GuidePoint standards:
       - CRITICAL: RDS database has hardcoded password (violates 'No hardcoded secrets')
       - CRITICAL: S3 bucket allows public access (violates 'No public S3 buckets')
       - HIGH: Kubernetes pod running privileged (requires GuidePoint Security approval)
       
       I can fix all of these using GuidePoint's secure templates. Approve?"
```
