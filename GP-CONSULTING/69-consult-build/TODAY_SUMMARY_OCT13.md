## üéØ Demo Value

### For Interviews

**Question:** "Show me a complex security project you've built."

**Answer:** "I recently conducted a comprehensive security assessment and built automated incident response for a financial services project."

**Demo Flow:**

1. **Show the problem** (5 min)
   ```bash
   # Show gap analysis
   cat SCANNER_FIXER_MATRIX.txt
   # Point out: Runtime incident response = 0%
   ```

2. **Show the solution** (10 min)
   ```bash
   # Show incident response agent
   cat agents/incident-response/guardduty_responder.py | head -100

   # Show test finding
   cat agents/incident-response/test-finding.json

   # Run dry-run demo
   python3 agents/incident-response/guardduty_responder.py \
     --finding-file agents/incident-response/test-finding.json \
     --dry-run
   ```

3. **Show the impact** (5 min)
   ```bash
   # Show coverage improvement
   cat INCIDENT_RESPONSE_COMPLETE.md
   # Point out: 0% ‚Üí 95% coverage, <2 min response time
   ```

**Key Talking Points:**
- Identified gaps through systematic analysis (20+ scanners)
- Built production-grade solution (1,250+ lines)
- Reduced MTTR from hours to <2 minutes
- Supports compliance (PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO27001)
