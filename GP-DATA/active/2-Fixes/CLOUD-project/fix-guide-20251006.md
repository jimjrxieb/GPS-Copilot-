# Security Fix Guide: CLOUD-project

**Generated:** 2025-10-06 23:52:51
**Run ID:** 18300191954
**Priority:** HIGH/CRITICAL findings only

## Summary

- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL:** 0 finding(s)
- ðŸŸ  **HIGH:** 2 finding(s)

---

## Issue 1: Missing User Instruction

### ðŸ”´ Severity: HIGH

**Category:** Build Process
**File:** `Dockerfile`:1

### Description

A user should be specified in the dockerfile, otherwise the image will run as root

### Current Code

```dockerfile
>>>   1: FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk11
      2:     
      3: EXPOSE 8080
      4:  
```

### Risk

- **Privilege Escalation:** Container running as root increases attack surface
- **Impact:** Compromised container = root access to host
- **Exploitability:** High if container is breached

### Recommended Fix

```dockerfile
# Add before CMD/ENTRYPOINT
RUN addgroup -g 1001 appuser && adduser -u 1001 -G appuser -s /bin/sh -D appuser
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser
```

### Verification

```bash
# After applying fix, verify:
# 1. Re-run security scan
# 2. Check finding is resolved
# 3. Test application functionality
```

## Issue 2: Privilege Escalation Allowed

### ðŸ”´ Severity: HIGH

**Category:** Insecure Configurations
**File:** `deployment-service.yaml`:16

### Description

Containers should not run with allowPrivilegeEscalation in order to prevent them from gaining more privileges than their parent process

### Current Code

```yaml
     13:         app: boardgame
     14:     spec:
     15:       containers:
>>>  16:         - name: boardgame
     17:           image: linksrobot/gh_boardgame:latest # Image that will be used to containers in the cluster
     18:           imagePullPolicy: Always
     19:           ports:
```

### Risk

- **Privilege Escalation:** Processes can gain elevated privileges
- **Impact:** Attackers can escalate from limited user to root
- **Exploitability:** High in multi-tenant environments

### Recommended Fix

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### Verification

```bash
# After applying fix, verify:
# 1. Re-run security scan
# 2. Check finding is resolved
# 3. Test application functionality
```

## Next Steps

1. **Apply fixes** following the guidance above
2. **Test changes** in dev/staging environment
3. **Re-run security scan** to verify resolution
4. **Commit changes** with descriptive message
5. **Monitor** for any regressions

## Commands

```bash
# Re-scan after fixes
jade analyze-gha jimjrxieb/CLOUD-project <new-run-id>

# View evidence log
grep "analyze_gha" ~/.jade/evidence.jsonl | jq
